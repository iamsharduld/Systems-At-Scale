# Distributed Database Architecture

Distributed databases are used to store and manage data across a network of interconnected computers. They ensure data consistency, availability, and fault tolerance across multiple locations.

### Nodes
- **Data Centers**: May contain multiple racks of servers and storage devices.
- **Clusters**: Groups of servers that work together.
- **Servers**: Individual physical or virtual machines.

### Data Distribution
- **Sharding**: Divides data into smaller chunks and distributes across nodes.
- **Replication**: Keeps multiple copies of data in sync.

### Query Processing
- **Query Router**: Directs queries to the appropriate nodes.
- **Query Executors**: Execute queries on individual nodes.
- **Aggregator**: Combines results into a final result set.

### Consistency and Coordination
- **Consensus Protocols**: Ensure nodes agree on the data state.
- **Synchronization Services**: Provide coordination among nodes.
- **Consistency Models**: Different consistency guarantees.

### Transaction Management
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Ensures accurate transaction processing.
- **Distributed Lock Manager**: Manages locks on data across different nodes.

### Networking
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute client requests among different nodes.
- **Networking Protocols**: Underlying communication between nodes.

### Monitoring and Management
- **Monitoring Tools**: Track the system's performance.
- **Management Console**: Centralized interface for administrative tasks.

### Real-World Applications

#### Netflix
Netflix uses Apache Cassandra as a distributed database to handle its extensive catalog and customer activity. Cassandra's ability to scale horizontally and provide high availability makes it suitable for serving millions of global users.

#### Uber
Uber relies on distributed databases like Schemaless and CockroachDB for managing geolocation data, ride-hailing requests, and other real-time operations. These databases' resilience and low-latency response times are critical for Uber's global service.
