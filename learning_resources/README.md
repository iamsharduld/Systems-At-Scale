### Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is a technique used to distribute data across multiple nodes, minimizing reorganization when nodes are added or removed. It's commonly used in distributed caches and databases.

- **How It Works**: Maps both data and nodes onto a hash ring. Data is assigned to the nearest node on the ring.
- **Advantages**: Reduces the need to move data when nodes are added or removed.
- **Related Topics**: Hash Functions, Virtual Nodes

### Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server bears too much demand.

- **Strategies**: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash
- **Session Persistence**: Techniques to ensure that a user's consecutive requests are sent to the same server.
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring the health of the servers to avoid sending requests to failed or underperforming servers.

### [Distributed Databases](./distributed_databases/README.md)

Distributed databases spread data across multiple physical locations. They are designed to improve performance, availability, and fault tolerance.

- **Types**: Horizontal Partitioning, Vertical Partitioning
- **CAP Theorem**: Balancing Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.
- **Database Systems**: Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL Cluster
- **Replication and Sharding** :Replication ensures that data is duplicated across multiple nodes, while sharding partitions data to spread it across servers.

  - **Replication Types**: Master-Slave, Peer-to-Peer
  - **Sharding Strategies**: Range-based, Directory-based, Hash-based

### Distributed Messaging

Distributed messaging systems facilitate communication between different parts of a scalable system, ensuring high throughput and fault tolerance.

- **Messaging Patterns**: Publish-Subscribe, Queuing
- **Brokers**: [Kafka](./distributed_messaging/kafka.md), RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ
- **Delivery Guarantees**: At-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once delivery
- **Fault Tolerance**: Techniques for recovering from failures
- **Scalability**: Ability to grow by adding more components

### [Caching Strategies](./cache/README.md)

Caching improves system performance by storing instances of data in high-speed storage areas.

- **Types**: In-memory caches, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- **Cache Eviction Policies**: LRU, FIFO, LFU

### Microservices Architecture

Microservices break an application into small, independent services that run as separate processes.

- **Benefits**: Scalability, Maintainability, Flexibility
- **Challenges**: Data consistency, Network latency

### Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance ensures that a system continues to operate even if some components fail.

- **Techniques**: Redundancy, Failover, Graceful Degradation

### Monitoring and Logging

Effective monitoring and logging provide insights into system performance, security, and user behavior.

- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Metrics**: CPU Utilization, Memory Usage, Error Rates
