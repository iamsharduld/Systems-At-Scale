# Fault Tolerance

In the realm of distributed systems, **fault tolerance** describes the system's ability to continue its functions and produce the desired outcome even in the face of failures, be they hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, or software errors. The ultimate goal is resilience, ensuring the system remains operable, ideally without users detecting any issues.

## Redundancy
By deploying multiple instances of services or data, we ensure continuity. For instance, if one database replica goes offline, another is ready to serve requests.

## Recovery
This refers to the system's ability to revert to its last known good state after an unexpected event. Techniques include regular backups and detailed disaster recovery protocols.

## Failover
Should a system component fail, the system can automatically shift operations to a standby component or process, ensuring uninterrupted service.

## Failback
Once a failed component is repaired or restored, operations can then revert or "fail back" to the primary system component.

## Health Checks
Periodic assessments determine the health of various system components. Should a component exhibit signs of failure, preemptive actions can be taken.

## Quorum
In distributed environments, a quorum ensures that decisions (like writing data) are made only when a majority of nodes agree, thereby ensuring data consistency and integrity.

**Note**: Distributed systems, by nature, have an inherent complexity. The fault tolerance mechanisms mentioned above, when effectively implemented, ensure a system's high availability and resilience in the face of inevitable challenges.
